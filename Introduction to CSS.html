        <p style="background-color: crimson;color: aquamarine;">In its present format, the Champions League begins in early July with three qualifying rounds and a play-off round, all
        played over two legs. The seven surviving teams enter the league phase, joining 29 teams qualified in advance. The 36
        teams each play eight opponents, four home and four away. The 24 highest-ranked teams proceed to the knockout phase that
        culminates with the final match in late May or early June.[6] The winner of the Champions League automatically qualifies
        for the following year's Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup, and the FIFA Club World Cup.[7][8]</p>
